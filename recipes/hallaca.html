        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The hallaca is the heart of the Venezuelan Christmas and represents
            a cultural fusion of its roots. It consists of a thin corn dough
            colored with onoto (annatto), filled with a hearty stew of finely
            chopped meats (beef, pork, and chicken) seasoned with a perfect
            balance of sweet and savory notes from sugar cane (papelón),
            pickles, raisins, and olives. This ensemble is wrapped in smoked
            plantain leaves, tied with kitchen twine (pabilo), and boiled,
            allowing the flavors to meld into a unique savory tamale that
            symbolizes family unity.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                For the stew: Beef, pork, and chicken, onions, garlic, ají dulce
                (sweet chili), bell peppers, scallions, capers, red wine,
                papelón (raw cane sugar), and corn flour for thickening.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the dough: Pre-cooked corn flour, pork lard (or oil) infused
                with annatto, and chicken broth.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the garnish: Onion rings, bell pepper strips, green olives,
                raisins, capers, blanched almonds, and bacon.
            </li>
            <li>
                For wrapping: Smoked plantain leaves (cleaned and sorted) and
                pabilo (cotton twine).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare the stew: Cook the meats with the aromatics, spices, and
                a touch of sweetness until you have a thick, flavorful stew. It
                is highly recommended to let it rest overnight to enhance the
                flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the dough: Mix the corn flour with the broth and the
                annatto-infused lard until you reach a soft, yellow, and pliable
                consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the leaves: Wash and dry the plantain leaves, removing
                the thick central vein and sorting them by size (base leaf and
                outer wrap).
            </li>
            <li>
                Extend and fill: Grease a leaf, flatten a ball of dough until
                thin, add a portion of the stew, and arrange the garnishes
                beautifully on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold and tie: Fold the leaf to seal the filling, wrap it with a
                second reinforcement leaf, and secure it firmly with the twine
                using a traditional grid pattern.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cooking: Boil the hallacas in a large pot of salted water for
                approximately one hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Resting: Let them cool and then refrigerate. Ideally, wait at
                least 24 hours before eating so the flavors can fully set.
