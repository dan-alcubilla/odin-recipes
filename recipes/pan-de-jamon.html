        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The pan de jamón (ham bread) is the indispensable companion of the
            Venezuelan Christmas dinner, created in the early 20th century in a
            Caracas bakery. It is a soft, slightly sweet enriched bread roll
            stuffed with a generous filling of smoked ham, bacon, green olives,
            and raisins. This combination creates an exquisite contrast between
            the sweetness of the dough and the saltiness of the cured meats and
            olives, resulting in a golden, glossy loaf that is a true feast of
            flavors.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                For the dough: Bread flour, warm milk, yeast, sugar, eggs,
                butter, and a pinch of salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the filling: Smoked ham (sliced or chopped), bacon strips,
                green olives stuffed with pimento, and black raisins.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the finish: Egg wash (beaten egg) and a touch of papelón
                (raw cane sugar syrup) or honey for shine and color.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Activate the yeast: Mix the yeast with a bit of warm milk and
                sugar, and let it rest until it becomes foamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the dough: Combine the flour with the activated yeast, the
                rest of the milk, eggs, and butter. Knead until you get an
                elastic, smooth texture that doesn't stick to your hands.
            </li>
            <li>
                First rise: Let the dough rest in a greased bowl, covered with a
                damp cloth, in a warm place until it doubles in size (about 1 to
                2 hours).
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll out the dough: Stretch the dough with a rolling pin on a
                floured surface to form a rectangle about 5 mm thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill the bread: Place a single row of olives along one edge (so
                they end up in the center when rolled), distribute the ham
                across the surface, add the bacon strips, and scatter the
                raisins evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll and seal: Roll the dough tightly. Seal the edges and prick
                the surface with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Second rise and baking: Let the formed loaf rest for 30 minutes.
                Brush with egg wash and bake at 180°C for about 35-40 minutes or
                until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Final touch: Upon removing it from the oven, you can brush it
                with a bit of papelón syrup for extra shine and its
                characteristic sweet aroma.
            </li>
