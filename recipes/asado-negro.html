        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The Asado Negro is one of the most iconic and elegant dishes of
            Venezuelan cuisine, famous for its characteristic dark color and
            deep sweet-and-sour flavor. The star is the "muchacho redondo" (eye
            of round roast), which is seared at high heat in a pot with oil and
            sugar or papelón until the surface turns nearly black (without
            burning). It is then slow-cooked in a sauce made of red wine,
            onions, ají dulce, and spices, resulting in incredibly tender meat
            that melts in your mouth, smothered in a velvety sauce that is the
            pride of any family table.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The meat: One eye of round roast (about 1.5 to 2 kg).</li>
            <li>
                For the marinade and sauce: Onions, garlic, bell pepper, ají
                dulce (sweet chili), red wine, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and
                black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the caramelization: Grated papelón (raw cane sugar) or brown
                sugar and vegetable oil.
            </li>
            <li>Additional liquids: Beef broth or water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Marinate the meat: A day before (or a few hours early), prick
                the meat and trim excess fat. Marinate with crushed garlic,
                salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and some of the wine.
            </li>
            <li>
                The "blackening": In a large, heavy pot, heat the oil and add
                the papelón or sugar. When the sugar melts and begins to bubble
                with an intense dark color, place the meat in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Marinate the meat: A day before (or a few hours early), prick
                the meat and trim excess fat. Marinate with crushed garlic,
                salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and some of the wine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear: Turn the meat to brown it evenly on all sides until it is
                practically black. This step is crucial for the final color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add vegetables: Add the finely chopped onion, bell pepper, and
                ají dulce to the pot. Sauté for a few minutes until softened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slow cook: Pour in the remaining marinade, the red wine, and
                some broth until the meat is halfway covered. Cover and cook
                over low heat for 2 to 3 hours, turning the meat occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the sauce: Once the meat is very tender, remove it from
                the pot. Let the sauce continue to simmer until it thickens and
                becomes glossy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice and serve: Let the meat rest before slicing it into
                rounds. Serve them smothered in the hot sauce. It is
                traditionally accompanied by white rice and tajadas (fried
                plantains).
