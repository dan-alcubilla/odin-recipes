# 🎄 Venezuelan Christmas Recipes Project

This is my first web project where I put into practice the fundamentals of frontend development. Through this website featuring traditional Venezuelan recipes (Hallaca, Pan de Jamón, and Asado Negro), I have consolidated my initial knowledge of web structures and version control.

## 🚀 Key Learnings

In this repository, I have demonstrated mastery of the following technical skills:

### 1. Version Control (Git)

I learned the essential commands to manage a project's workflow:

* `git init`: Initializing the repository.
* `git add`: Staging files for a commit.
* `git commit -m "..."`: Recording changes with descriptive messages.
* `git push`: Uploading the code to the cloud (GitHub).

### 2. HTML Structure and Semantics

* **HTML Boilerplate:** Creating the base structure of an HTML5 document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
* **Elements & Tags:** Correct use of headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and horizontal rules (`<hr>`).
* **Lists:** Implementation of unordered lists (`<ul>`) for ingredients and ordered lists (`<ol>`) for preparation steps.
* **Links & Images:**
* Inserting images (`<img>`) with `alt` attributes for accessibility.
* Using anchor tags (`<a>`) for external links and authorship credits.
* Handling element positioning (using `<div>`, `<br>`, or `<figure>` to place credits below images).



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **Git**
* **GitHub**

## 📖 How to View This Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

```


2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### Next Steps

My goal is to continue scaling this project by adding **CSS** styles so that the presentation of the recipes is as incredible as their taste.
